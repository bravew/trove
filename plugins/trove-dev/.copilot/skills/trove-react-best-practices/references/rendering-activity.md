## Use Activity Component for Show/Hide

Use React's `<Activity>` to preserve state/DOM for expensive components that frequently toggle visibility.

> **Availability:** `<Activity>` went stable in **React 19.2** (Oct 2025). On 19.0 / 19.1 it ships as `unstable_Activity`; check your React version before using.

**Usage:**

```tsx
import { Activity } from 'react'

function Dropdown({ isOpen }: Props) {
  return (
    <Activity mode={isOpen ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
      <ExpensiveMenu />
    </Activity>
  )
}
```

Avoids expensive re-renders and state loss.
